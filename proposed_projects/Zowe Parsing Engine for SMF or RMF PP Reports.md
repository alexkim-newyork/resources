# * Zowe Parsing Engine for SMF or RMF PP Reports *

## Description
* Zowe is a great systems operations tool. One of the systems programmers or performance analyzer's job is to decode SMF/RMF reports to check system's health. Having a generic parser for SMF datasets and/or RMF(or CMF) reports for Zowe would open various opportunities to create/re-use many open-source monitoring tools out there. *

## Additional Information
* z/OS RMF User's Guide: https://www-01.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zOSV2R3sc342664?OpenDocument
* RMF for zOSMF : https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.erbb200/zosmf.htm 
* RMF Postprocessor : Long-term reporting with the Postprocessor https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.erbru00/pppa.htm


## Desirable Skills
* NodeJS*
* NoSQL/stream database*
* Python skill is good to have*
* Basic computer architecture*

## Expected Outcome
* Goal of the project: create a parsing engine runs in z/OS node.js takes SMF datasets, RMF/CMF reports, then create outputs in CSV format(or into stream database).*

## Difficultly
*Medium*
