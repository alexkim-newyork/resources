# * Zowe Parsing Engine for SMF or RMF PP Reports *

## Description
* Zowe is a great systems operations tool. One of the systems programmers or performance analyzer's job is to decode SMF/RMF reports to check system's health. Having a generic parser for SMF datasets and/or RMF(or CMF) reports for Zowe would open various opportunities to create/re-use many open-source monitoring tools out there. *
